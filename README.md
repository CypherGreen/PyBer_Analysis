# **PyBer_Analysis**

## **Overview of the analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride-share data and create a DataFrame by city type and a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. This yielded a more cohesive summary report that can be used by decision-makers at the ride-share company.

## **Results**
 
**Summary DataFrame**

* During this analysis time frame there were more rides completed in urban areas by more drivers.
* Ride-sharing in urban areas produced the highest grossing revenue  at $39,854.38.
* The highest fare per ride were in rural areas.
* Rural areas also produced higher fare rates for drivers.

**Total Fare by City Type Graph**

The graph below helps to illustrate how urban areas produced significantly higher total fare than rural and suburban areas. In the first four months of 2019, the different types of city types had different areas of high peaks and low points in comparison. 

* Urban areas had a significant decrease in revenue right before April and right after that month. 
* Suburban areas had a higher peak at the end of February but decreased soon after and stayed steadily neither significantly higher nor lower in comparison.
* Rural areas consistently underperformed in contrast to the other two areas. Its highest grossing peak barely reached the $500 revenue mark.

## **Summary**
In conclusion, there needs to be more drivers recruited for these rural areas. They didn't perform the best when it came to overall highest grossing revenue, however those rides produce more money per ride. More advertising for the company should be targeted to these areas to entice more people to pay for the service. The same can also be done to help improve the numbers for the suburban areas. Since the number of total rides is so low for these areas, it could entice new people to try ride-sharing for their first time if there were initial discount plans to start them with and perhaps even a reward club membership where they receive special ackowledgement for their company loyalty.
